# PIR-Motion-Sensor
The "Motion Detection with Arduino and PIR Sensor" is an Arduino sketch that demonstrates motion detection using a Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor. 
The sketch is designed to work with an Arduino board and a PIR sensor to detect motion and control an LED based on the sensor's input.
